# Hi, I'm Tiago Schwartz

I am from San Francisco and attend UCSB. I am going into my third year and currently pursuing a degree in Geography with an emphasis in GIS and a degree in Linguistics. I used to live in Portugal which has had a positive impact on my life. In my free time I play and watch a lot of soccer.
