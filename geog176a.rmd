In the summer of 2020 I took a class GIS course based in R. I wrote some code, and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of links! 

## [Building a project website]()

- For this project, we were tasked with creating our first website 
- To do this we had to sync Github with R and have them be able to communicate with each other
- The purpose of this project is to begin a portfolio of my GIS work that I can later show to potential employers
